# ReturnGuard Android v0.1.0-beta

Release date: 2026-02-27

## Scope
- Android baseline stabilization after migration from the single-HTML prototype.
- OCR-first data entry flow made production-like for closed beta usage.

## Included in this baseline
- Compose UI with add/edit/list flow.
- Room database with local-first behavior.
- WorkManager reminder trigger (`Reminder` action).
- JSON import/export.
- OCR scan flow via ML Kit scanner + text recognition.
- OCR draft confidence and save guard for low-confidence drafts.
- OCR debug panel for ranked extraction candidates and raw text.
- Improved parser logic for:
  - Product line detection
  - Merchant canonicalization
  - Date extraction
  - Price extraction with outlier handling

## Manual validation snapshot
- Build: `:app:assembleDebug` succeeded on Java 17.
- Lint: `:app:lintDebug` succeeded.
- Device sample (Neureiter invoice):
  - Product: correct
  - Merchant: correct
  - Date: correct (`2024-07-09`)
  - Price: correct (`3872,12`)

## Beta known risks
- OCR still depends on document quality and layout variety.
- Confidence score is calibrated but still heuristic.
- Parser test corpus is not yet broad enough for high-variance receipt sets.

## Next checkpoint
- Run 30-receipt smoke matrix and collect extraction metrics per field.
- Use results to prioritize the top 3 parser error classes before closed testing.
